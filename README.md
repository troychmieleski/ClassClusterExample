ClassClusterExample
===================

The Class Cluster pattern presents a simple interface to a compelx underlying implementation. The pattern provides a public class for use in application code, but when applications attempt to allocate in- stances of the public class, the framework actually provides instances of private subclasses of the public class. This is a simple example of using a class cluster or abstract factory design pattern.
